# riprap

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/darcyabjones/riprap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/darcyabjones/riprap)

Tools for detecting and quantifying RIP-like signatures in genomes.
riprap is a young project and it might stay half baked for a while, but eventually I hope to update and extend ripcal.

## Why the name?

I thought it was fun to say.
I googled it to make sure it wasn't offensive and it just means a bunch of loose rocks or something.
You may project your own loose disordered rock analogies for fungal genomes at your pleasure :)


## Contributions

I'm not expecting many people to see this, but I welcome input.
This might form part of my PhD, but we could jump that hurdle when we come to it.

Bye.
